  <p>Cody loves to surf so he thought it would be perfect to work at a place where all animals are free to do as they please and express tbemselves.
  He was thinking about how to make that possible and he thought of this School of Life. He founded the school so children of the animal kingdom, no matter their breed,
  can feel free and comfortable to learn the hobbies and activitied they love without worrying about their communities thoughts and opinions of themselves.
  He also teaches the surfing lessons to kids of the ages between 6 and 16. Don't be afraid to chase a dream you have even if it goes againt societal "norms."</p>

  <p>Ever since Nick was young people hated him for being a "predator", kids would bully him and he was never included in activitites with other kids
  just because of his ancestors reputation but he is not a reflection of them. Nick loves mystery and the mind puzzles used for solving crime. He teaches
  the Criminal Justice and Investigation class to help kids realize that they can be involved in the criminal jsutice world no matter what role (predator or prey)
  or size you are. No matter what anyone says.</p>

  <p> Simon Seville is a triplet and he out of the three he has always been considered a nerd because he is smart. He wants to help kids to better learn math
  in all forms more in depth because he knows being passionate about math may be frowned upon or considered weird by other school children. Math is something he has
  always found intriguing so being able to share that love with other students and help them grow their own appreciation because they want to is something that he loves.</p>

    style="float: left; Margin-right: 15px;"

  <p>His whole life Po was told by the people he loved most that he would never be good at Kung Fu and was destined to work at his adopted father's ramen shop.
  Po had a vision and a dream and he was going to chase it and that he did. He has done Kug Fu with all sorts of animals and many of them are animals you wouldn't
  expect to be capable of the skill. Typically they ones you'd least expect end up being the best of the best. He wants to help kids embrac their love for Kung Fu
  and have that guidance and support from the start that he was never given.</p>
