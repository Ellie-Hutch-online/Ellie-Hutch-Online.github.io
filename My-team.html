  <p>Cody loves to surf so he thought it would be perfect to work at a place where all animals are free to do as they please and express tbemselves.
  He was thinking about how to make that possible and he thought of this School of Life. He founded the school so children of the animal kingdom, no matter their breed,
  can feel free and comfortable to learn the hobbies and activitied they love without worrying about their communities thoughts and opinions of themselves.
  He also teaches the surfing lessons to kids of the ages between 6 and 16. Don't be afraid to chase a dream you have even if it goes againt societal "norms."</p>
